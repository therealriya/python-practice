# python-practice
A collection of Python programs, exercises, data science experiments, and machine learning mini-projects created while learning and improving Python skills. This repo documents my journey from basics to advanced topics with clean, structured code.


# 🐍 Python Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Python practice** repository!  
This repo contains all the Python code I write while learning the language — from basic scripts to intermediate exercises and machine learning projects.
